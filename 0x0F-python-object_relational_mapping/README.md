 in this repo I'm gonna implement and solve some tasks about sqlalchemy
 and mysqldb and I'm gonna tinker a little bit with database
Most of the tasks will be about serialization and deserialization to the database.
like insert and query delete amd update and query with filter
and will use both sqlalchemy and mysqldb technology to manipulate databases data
